#This code gives the number of total clones, the number of unique clones, the number of clones that are present 2 times and the number of clones that are present more than 2 times
#We upload the excel data and then clean the data for the relevant information. Then we find the expanded clones (defined in terms of TCRusage and CDR3a and CDR3b sequences)
#For the expanded clones, we pool together the data for each different kind of patients
#Then we find the number of total clones, the number of unique clones, the number of clones that are present 2 times and the number of clones that are present more than 2 times
