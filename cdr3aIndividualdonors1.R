#This code is written to find the CDR3a distribution as well as the length of CDR3a of the patient samples.
#We upload the excel data and then clean the data for the relevant information. Then we find the expanded clones (defined in terms of TCRusage and CDR3a and CDR3b sequences)
#For the expanded clones we find the distribution of CDR3a sequences as well as the length of the CDR3a sequences
