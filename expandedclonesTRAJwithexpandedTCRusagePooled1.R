#This code is used to create a heatmap to get the TRAJ distrubution of the patient samples under stimulated and un-stimulated conditions
#We upload the excel data and then clean the data for the relevant information. Then we find the expanded clones (defined in terms of TCRusage and CDR3a and CDR3b sequences)
#For the expanded clones, we pool together the data for all the patients at stimulatd and un-stimulated conditions
#We calculate the fraction of different TRAJ and plot them as a heatmap with x-axis giving the different patients at stimulated and un-stimulated conditions and the y-axis giving the fractions of TRAJ expression
